First CTF is the Idiot Test.
It is an html vulnerability where the password can be found by inspecting elements in the html source code page.
Right click the screen and Inspect Element, then ctrl+f and search for the word password.
The search will lead to a line of code saying the password in it, 
paste the password or type it into the password entry field.
